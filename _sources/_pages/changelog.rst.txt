ðŸŽ‰ **Initial public release of PyASGE** ðŸŽ‰

This is the first public release of PyASGE. It is considered beta quality.
From this point onwards any changes to v1 will be made with backwards
compatibility in mind as the API can be considered stable. Changes that break
the API will result in a major version bump.
